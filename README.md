### Author: Minhang Xu, Kevin Elaba, Jiayi Li, Gweneth Ge

All the code should be put under the same folder that holds the data.

* Before running all the code, clean the data first. Run "clean_data.py" and get "cleaned_K8.csv". Then all the methods are performed on "cleaned_K8.csv"
* Logistic regression has following files: Logistic Regression_imb.ipynb, Logistic Regression_SMOTE.ipynb, Logistic Regression_SMOTE_underSampling.ipynb
* K-nearest neighbors has following files: ML KNN - update.ipynb
* Support Vector Machine has following files: "imbalanced_svm.ipynb"
